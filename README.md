Online Image Matching App Documentation

Overview
This application allows users to upload an image, and then searches for matching images from a set of images stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket or any online service. The app uses the Google Cloud Vision API to analyze the uploaded image and compare it with others stored in a cloud-based collection.

Key Features:
Image Upload: Users can upload images through a simple web interface.
Google Vision API: Uses the Google Vision API to analyze the uploaded image.
Image Comparison: Compares the uploaded image with other images stored in a cloud service to find matches.
Results Display: Displays the matches based on similarity or other criteria returned by the Vision API.
